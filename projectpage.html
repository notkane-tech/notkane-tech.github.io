                <h3>Project 1: Building My Portfolio</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I performed a detailed threat analysis of a corporate network. Using various tools, I identified potential cybersecurity threats and developed strategies to mitigate them. 
                    This project helped me understand the importance of proactive threat management and the use of advanced monitoring tools.

                <h3>Project 2: Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
                <p>
                    This project focused on vulnerability scanning and risk mitigation for a mid-sized company. I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment using both automated and manual tools, 
                    providing the organization with a full report of weaknesses and remediation steps.

                <h3>Project 3: Ethical Hacking Simulation</h3>
                <p>
                    This project involved simulating ethical hacking techniques to assess the security of a company's internal network. I executed penetration testing, analyzed vulnerabilities, 
                    and delivered recommendations for improving network defenses, ensuring compliance with industry standards.
