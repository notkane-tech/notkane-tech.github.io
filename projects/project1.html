            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
            Before you can hack into anything, you’ve gotta know how it’s put together. Understanding what makes it tick is the first step in figuring out how to make it <em>not</em> tick. That’s true for anything, including HTML and CSS-based websites. Sure, attacks like XSS and SQL injections aren’t the monsters they used to be, but learning them gives you a solid foundation for bigger, badder things down the line.

            <h3>Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>Github</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Challenges & Solutions</h3>
            <p>The hardest part of starting anything is figuring out where to begin, right? After binge-watching a few YouTube tutorials, I finally managed to throw together an <code>index.html</code> file and a <code>style.css</code> file to go with it. Progress! But then came the real question... now what?</p>

            <br>

            <p>Since I’m all about the Ubuntu Monospace font (for obvious reasons), I went with that. Then it was time to dive into colors, layouts, and navigation buttons. I tried to keep things simple... until I accidentally made the navigation buttons appear in a different order on every page. Oops. Thankfully, it was an easy fix, but that little mistake got me thinking about <strong>User Experience</strong>—if it bugged me, it’s definitely going to bug someone else. And if it annoys them enough, they’ll probably bounce from the site. Not ideal, right?</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>So, what keeps <em>me</em> on a webpage? (Besides my unhealthy obsession with <em>Terraria</em>, requiring me to keep a wiki tab open at all times.) For me, it’s the cool animations and the way everything feels like it belongs. Think of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> website—it’s literally designed to make you stick around.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>This is where JavaScript came into play. Did I <em>need</em> to add JS? Absolutely not. Was it worth every forgotten closed function and hours of debugging? Probably not either... but it looks awesome! The animations on the navigation bar, the card flips, and even the contact form (thanks to Formspree's API) were all powered by JavaScript. And in the end, it was totally worth the headache.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Outcome</h3>
            <p>Well, here it is! My somewhat functioning website.</p>

            <br>
            
            <p>Just a heads-up: this beauty was designed on Desktop, for Desktop. So if you’re browsing on your phone, you might notice a few... <em>quirks</em>. Nothing major, just a little heads-up that the layout might not play nice on smaller screens.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>But don’t worry—I’ll be updating and tweaking this site as my journey progresses. It’s a work in progress, but hey, that’s part of the fun, right? And let’s be real, it’s just you and me here, so it’s all about quality over quantity anyway!</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Here’s to a working portfolio... for now! Cheers!</p>
